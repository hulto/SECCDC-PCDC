# Linux Info
## Resources

Here is a small list of potentially useful pages to read regarding general linux use/administration and security. 

### Security 

- [Basic Security](https://linux-audit.com/ubuntu-server-hardening-guide-quick-and-secure/)
- [Ubuntu - Security, Servers, Administration, etc](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/security-introduction)
- [Linux Audit Tool - Lynis](https://linux-audit.com/lynis/) 

### Web
 - [Basic Apache in Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-apache#1-overview)
 - [Very thorough php tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_installation_linux.htm)
 - [CentOS info with PHP web server basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/linux_admin/configure_php_in_centos_linux.htm) 

### Administration
- [CentOS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/linux_admin/index.htm) 
- [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SystemAdministration)
  - Pay closer attention to "Logs and Scheduling" and "Users and Permissions" 

### Books
- [DevOps for the Desperate](https://nostarch.com/devops-desperate)
  - DevOps is more or less the same as system administration. This book goes into detail about automating sys-admin tasks which does include some security aspects. 
- [Wicked Cool Shell Scripts](https://nostarch.com/wcss2)
  - Learn shell scripting! Mastering Bash will help so much with Linux automation. 
- [How Linux Works](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks3)
  - I haven't read this yet but I should - it looks really good.
- [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://nostarch.com/linuxbasicsforhackers)
  - I have yet to finish this book (even though I started reading it my freshman year), but it does have some really good info, especially with a hacker's perspective. This book is actually how I started with Linux. 
- [Practical Linux Forensics](https://nostarch.com/practical-linux-forensics)
  - This book is probably very technical and will assume you know linux well. Looks like an amazing read though. This could **really** help in competitions and with your cybersec knowledge. 
- [The Linux Command Line](https://nostarch.com/tlcl2)
  - This is a **great** resource for learning how to operate linux via the CLI. It goes into so much detail and taught me a lot. **This is probably the best place to start with linux.**

### Also
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) 
  - Just search for linux things and there is almost always at least one good video to watch. 
- [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) 
  - I love this site! It has so much more than just general linux stuff - although it does have some rooms on this topic. I cannot recommend this site enough. 

Keep in mind there are so many other resources out there for all kinds of linux things. If you find some good ones, make a pull request with them added - any topic regarding linux!

## Notes

I haven't read through all the resources I've listed here, so if some are bad or inadaquate, whoops. But please feel free to find better ones and add them with a pull request! 

All of the books above are from No Starch Press - my favorite book publisher. They are, however, not only the one that produces books on these topcis. I've also had good success with [Manning](https://www.manning.com) and [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/search/?query=Security&extended_publisher_data=true&highlight=true&include_assessments=false&include_case_studies=true&include_courses=true&include_playlists=true&include_collections=true&include_notebooks=true&include_sandboxes=true&include_scenarios=true&is_academic_institution_account=false&source=user&sort=relevance&facet_json=true&json_facets=true&page=0&include_facets=true&include_practice_exams=true), so be sure to check those places out as well.
