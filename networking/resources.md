## Books 
- [**Practical Packet Analysis**](https://nostarch.com/packetanalysis3)
- [TCP/IP](https://nostarch.com/tcpip.htm)

- [Network Know-How](https://nostarch.com/networkknowhow)
- [Network Programming With Go](https://nostarch.com/networkprogrammingwithgo)
- [Network Flow Analysis](https://nostarch.com/networkflow)
- [Nagios](https://nostarch.com/nagios.htm)
- [The Book of IMAP](https://nostarch.com/imap)

- [Attacking Network Protocols](https://nostarch.com/networkprotocols) 
- [**The Practice of Network Security Monitoring**](https://nostarch.com/nsm) 

I've bolded the two I think are the best to read, especially pertaining to cyber defence. I would start with Practical Packet Analysis, then The Practice of NSM.
