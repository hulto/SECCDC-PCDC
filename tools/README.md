# Tools
Just a list of potentially helpful tools I've found through either my reading or general searching. I've not tested or worked with all of these, so keep that in mind. Some of them will require practice, so make sure to do so **before** a competition. 

## List
- [Binary Defense Systems](https://github.com/BinaryDefense/artillery)
  - Linux/Windows "honeypot, monitoring tool, and alerting system."
- [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie)
  - SSH Honeypot
- [weblabyrinth](https://github.com/mayhemiclabs/weblabyrinth)
  - Kind of funny honeypot 
  - I don't imagine this one would be especially useful in a cyber defence competition
- [FIR](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/FIR)
  - Tool to help manage Incident Response. 
- [LME](https://github.com/ukncsc/lme)
  - This is a learning tool and not something to be used in production (although it could probably help in competitions if we have nothing else) 
- [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) 
  - Amazing packet analysis tool
  - Can also act as an IDS 
- [Suricata](https://suricata.io/)
  - Amazing open-source tool for NSM/IDS/IPS/PCAP processing. We **definitly** should learn how to use this tool well and implement it in our competitions. 

## Please
Please go and search on your own for good tools for cyber defense and add them to this list with a pull-request! You can even program your own tools as I have done.
